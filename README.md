MAGD projects 

Lab 5 is a simple little project where you can click buttons on a TV to change the colors. For the first button, you have to press the 'c' key while hovering over it with the mouse to make it activate. The other two buttons simply work when they are clicked. 

Lab 6 is a fun little Halloween themed project where you can reveal a glowing pumpkin by flicking the mouse across the screen. He will continue following your mouse across the screen until you stop moving it, with him vanishing into darkness. 

Lab 10 is the most complex of all the projects, using the p5.scribble library to incorporate some cool scribble effects. While the code is more complex, in execution it is fairly simple. Every time the program is loaded, it will create a randomly sized, randomly colored, 10 wide bar graph with some nice elements from the p5.scribble library. After it is launched, the bar graph can continue to be randomized over and over again by pressing any keys 1-9.
